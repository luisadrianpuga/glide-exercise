# Incident Report: VAL-209 – Amount Input Issues

## Summary
- Reporter: Robert Lee  
- Priority: Medium  
- Description: The funding form accepted amounts with multiple leading zeros (e.g., 000123.45), confusing users and cluttering transaction logs.

## Impact
- Users thought the system mis-recorded amounts or ignored their input.
- Transaction history looked inconsistent, potentially impacting reporting.

## Detection
- Customer ticket VAL-209 highlighting that entering values like 0001.00 succeeded without warning.

## Root Cause
1. The frontend validator only checked for a basic numeric pattern, so any string of digits (including leading zeros) passed.
2. No additional logic stripped or rejected redundant zeros before submission.

## Resolution
- Updated the amount validation in `components/FundingModal.tsx` to:
  - Ensure the value matches a `digits[.up to 2 decimals]` pattern.
  - Reject values starting with `0` followed by more digits (unless the value is `0.xx`).
  - Keep existing checks for > $0.00 and <= $10,000.

## Verification
- Manual tests show entering `0005`, `00123.45`, or `0.00` now surfaces descriptive errors. Valid amounts like `5`, `5.50`, or `10.01` pass.

## Lessons Learned
1. Amount fields should normalize or reject redundant formatting to avoid confusion.
2. Centralize currency validation logic for reuse across forms and APIs.
3. Consider displaying a formatted preview of the parsed amount to reassure users.
