# Incident Report: UI-101 – Dark Mode Text Visibility

## Summary
- Reporter: Sarah Chen  
- Priority: Medium  
- Description: Input text appeared white on a white background when dark mode was enabled, making form fields unreadable.

## Impact
- Users could not see what they were typing in any form while using system dark mode, leading to mistakes and frustration.

## Detection
- Customer ticket UI-101 with reproduction steps (enable dark mode, open form, start typing).

## Root Cause
1. Our Tailwind/Next.js styles relied on default light theme colors; no overrides existed for `prefers-color-scheme: dark`.
2. Inputs inherited white backgrounds while text also defaulted to near-white, causing white-on-white rendering.

## Resolution
- Added dark-mode specific overrides in `app/globals.css` targeting inputs, textareas, and selects.
- Ensured text color, background, border, and placeholder colors are set to accessible shades in dark mode.

## Verification
- Manual testing in a dark-mode browser now shows inputs with a dark background, light text, and readable placeholder hints.

## Lessons Learned
1. Always test core UI flows under both light and dark themes.
2. Centralize theme overrides (e.g., `globals.css`) so components inherit the correct styles.
3. Consider adding automated visual tests or lint rules to catch missing dark-mode support.
